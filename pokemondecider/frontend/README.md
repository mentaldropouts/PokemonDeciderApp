# This Branch is a stepping stone onto which great trainers will plan their attack
There will be bountiful battles won and plentiful pokemon slain as a result of 
the work me and my men are doing. We charged into the battle against strategy 
and besiege the ignorance of all the trainers who do not know the optimal 
choice to make. For we will make it for them! 

### Specifications

* **Name** :        1.0.1b
* **Builds off** :  main  
* **Purpose** :   templates to use in the backend in 'handler.js' in the frontend and 'base.py' in the backend. Using Zach's algorithms in the file 'zAlg.py' we can either slot the function to the front or chose to implement something different like a battle simulator.
